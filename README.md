# Cranelift-Template [Unfinished]
Rust project template (Cargo-Generate) for Cranelift

Simple [Cargo-Generate](https://cargo-generate.github.io/cargo-generate/index.html) template for the [RustRover IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/) for a project using [Cranelift](https://cranelift.dev/). You will need to have Cranelift installed in order to be able to use this template. This is unfinished work...I will complete it when I have a better understanding of this stuff...
## Usage
If you want to use this template, you can use its [Link](https://github.com/HQ2000-CPP/Cranelift-Template/) to add it in the Project creation dialogue.
## Credits
Though it's probably not the actual source, I used the preconfigured [wasm-pack template](https://github.com/intellij-rust/wasm-pack-template/). You are free to use this yourself (if you trust me). I **cannot** guarantee that there aren't any errors here. If you find one, feel free to open an issue (or do it yourself).
